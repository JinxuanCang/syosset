# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        text: "At Syosset High School, we strive to provide an education that is
        challenging, thorough and useful, in an environment where students find
        joy in learning. We believe high school is a unique experience, valuable
        for its own sake. As individuals, our students deserve the opportunity
        to develop their distinctive talents. While all students should be
        challenged to think for themselves, we encourage them to work together
        to share their talents. Our goal is to create lifelong learners who
        continue to grow and explore long after their last test is taken. It is
        our hope that Syosset students will emerge as discerning, educated
        citizens—with the skills necessary to find success in the university, in
        the workplace, and in all the challenges life offers. Our administration and
        staff serve to model the values and character we expect of our students:
        patience, respect, integrity, dignity and empathy. We share our
        responsibility with parents and our community, and, in turn, hope to
        make Syosset High School students aware of their responsibility and
        connection to the larger world."
